Hello darlings,

Here you will find my methods to perform the analysis and test my hypothesis.

for generating the result(s) you have to execute the file "execute.sh". This script was made under Bash and R language.

But, you may have to install some libraries in R and install the program RevBayes and move into bin or change differents lines into the code and other functions.

This script is preliminary because was made to generate just one replicate

I hope MY commentaries are informative.

bye bye
